I worked mainly on the database model for this part of the project. For example, I made the visual model in google slides.
This model represents the courses, course instances, professors, reviews, students, and days the course is offered. 

Also, I implemented the Django ORM in python using the sqlite3 database. For this part I made five classes corresponding to the 
database model I made in google slides. I also represented all of the information that we need about courses, students, and
professors using different fields. Some of the most commonly used fields were char fields, time fields, and many to many fields. The least obviously implemented part of the model is how the days of the week that a class is offered are represented. I had to
make a new class called days and add a choices portion similar to the book status gone over in class. Toward the end of our
submission, we needed to add some new classes to the model to represent the reviews of professors and courses. So, I needed to update the data model in google drive.

Lastly, I worked on the group's markdown file. I added the overview, team members, design overview for the data models, and 
a problem/success for mt part of the project. In addition, I spoke about the design of the data model for the team video.
