While working on this project, I mainly focused on implementing the templates. 
I first created a base template containing our sidebar navigation and header and then used that as a base for all the other templates.
I then took everyone's html pages from project 1 and turned them into django templates. I had to work closely with chris who was
working on the views in order to do this. I additionally created a few additional templates, namely professors.html, students.html,
courses.html course-info.html, course-instances.html, and course-instance-info.html and implement views for a few of them.

Additionally, I setup the project structure for project 2. I created the django project, copied over all the correct files, created the web-app, ect.

Finally, as I finished my part of the project before the deadline I helped other team memebers complete their part of the project.
I helped pat finish the fake data, chris with the views, and connor with the models. I additionally made myself available to answer
questions regarding git, django, and python.
