I contributed to several things for this project submission. Firstly, I worked with pat to make sure that the user authentication and permissions were working. We did this by creating a student group and only allowing them to see their own pages and not to view the list of students. The students did not have the correct permission which only the admins had. 

I additionally contributed to making the shopping cart work. Students are now able to added and remove classes from their shopping cart. This involved working with forms. 

The last thing I contributed to this project was helping other project members finish their parts. I helped Akshaya troubleshoot the class search form.
