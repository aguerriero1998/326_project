# Innovative Idea
	Currently SPIRE is a pretty terrible system for registering for classes and setting up your next semester's schedule. 
	SPIRE has an archaic search feature, lacks an appealing UI and it makes it difficult to easily see what you have signed up
	for already and what classes you should be signing up for based on your major and year. The goal behind this project is to
	bring the UI of SPIRE's class registration portion up to date, while making an application that is more user friendly 
	and actually aids students in choosing which classes they should be taking. Our plan currently is to add a recommended class 
	section to SPIRE, as well as refine the search features currently found within SPIRE. We will also be making it easier to view 
	your schedule, while also formatting in a more appealing manner. All of these changes will be implemented on top of a more 
	modern UI, as opposed to the more archaic interface SPIRE currently implements.





# Important Data

	This web application will aim to help students with registering for classes, viewing there schedule and leaving feedback on classes. For this to work we will need a significant amount of data. Forcourses we would need data about student academics like classes taken, classes enrolled, student credit balance, and credit limit and we would also implement data for each class: time, location, professor, and prerequisites. This will require a dynamic listing of all the courses offered each semester, with the courses themselves and their requirements and information also needing to be able to be changed.
	Alongside existing features from Spire, we are aiming to implement our own innovative features to enhance student experience. We will implement a class/professor review system; this will require a catalog of data that includes a rating system (5 meat birds out of 5?) and student submitted comments. We also plan to implement major specific class searches: we would need to create a data based off of majors and their requirements to support this kind of search. For features like schedules and our student - student schedule sharing, we would need to have data for graphic representations for schedules. Having a friend social network system would also need some sort of graphing data to determine which students are friends with whom.
