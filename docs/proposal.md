# Innovative Idea

Please describe your team's innovative idea for your project.

# Important Data

	This web application will aim to help students with registering for classes, viewing there schedule and leaving feedback on classes. For this to work we will need a significant amount of data. Forcourses we would need data about student academics like classes taken, classes enrolled, student credit balance, and credit limit and we would also implement data for each class: time, location, professor, and prerequisites. This will require a dynamic listing of all the courses offered each semester, with the courses themselves and their requirements and information also needing to be able to be changed.
	Alongside existing features from Spire, we are aiming to implement our own innovative features to enhance student experience. We will implement a class/professor review system; this will require a catalog of data that includes a rating system (5 meat birds out of 5?) and student submitted comments. We also plan to implement major specific class searches: we would need to create a data based off of majors and their requirements to support this kind of search. For features like schedules and our student - student schedule sharing, we would need to have data for graphic representations for schedules. Having a friend social network system would also need some sort of graphing data to determine which students are friends with whom.
