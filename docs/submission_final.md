Data Model: 
![example image](final_imgs/datamodel.png)

In our data model we have students, professors, courses, course instances, course reviews, professor reviews, and days of the week. Students are the students at UMass. Courses are the courses offered at UMass. Course instances are what students enroll in for each semester. Professors are the people who are teaching the course for the semester. Course and professor reviews are remarks left by students about their courses and professors. Days of the week are days in which a course instance is held. Courses are connected to a course instance and course reviews. Course instances are connected to the students taking that instance and the professor teaching that instance. Days of the week the course instance is offered is also connected to course instance. The professor is connected to their reviews. Lastly, all of the reviews are connected to a student who wrote the reviews.

Authentication/Authorization: A final up-to-date description of how users are authenticated and any permissions for specific users (if any) that you used in your application. You should mention how they relate to which UI views are accessible.

Team Choice: Our team choice addition was to deploy our application to a server. Our website has the domain www.spire-is-bad.com is accessible on the internet. To accommodate for this we added a url and view to register a user. We additionally had to obtain a domain name and correctly set up DNS records so that our application is able to be accessed at the domain.

You should briefly mention your team choice component for your application. You should highlight any additions to your application that are part of your team choice, such as, URL routes, UI views, data model, to make it clear what your team choice addition is. 

Conclusion: A conclusion describing your teamâ€™s experience in working on this project. This should include what you learned through the design and implementation process, the difficulties you encountered, what your team would have liked to know before starting the project that would have helped you later, and any other technical hurdles that your team encountered.
