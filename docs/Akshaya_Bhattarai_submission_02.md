I worked on admin.py to customize the Django admin page to fit out data models appropriately. I connected models in models.py to admin page to make it possible to display and make changes to the database in the admin page. 

I also made few changes to models.py file. Few changes were required for it to work properly and to incorporate the changes that we realized were needed. Specifically, I added `get_shoppingcart` and `get_coursesnow` functions in models.

After the team did most of the assigned individual part, we all worked on the final "cleaning up" together to make sure everything was in sync.
