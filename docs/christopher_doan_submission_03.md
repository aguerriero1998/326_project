My main contributions for this project submission was with basic form. Alongside that I also edited together the main video for the submission and started the submission markdown for project3.

One section of the forms I was in charge of creating was to add course reviews for courses as a whole, and for professors. This creates reviews in the models and links to the course or professor the student is reviewing. This form contains one field, which takes in the actual review itself. The review is linked back to the student who leaves the review.

The other forms I created are based off of models in the database. I created edit info which requires the specific student's authentication and it would edit the student's info that could possible change throughout college like address, phone number, pronouns, or emergency contact. This would update the student's information in the database. The other form is accessed through an administrators's authentication and is the create/add a course form (found in the bottom of courses). This form is based off the course model. It allows for admins to add a course to the course catalog using information like its name, the course number, credits, decription, and subject.
