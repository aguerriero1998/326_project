I worked on two parts of this portion of the project. The first part that I worked
on was implementing the authentication part of this project. I worked with Alex on this
and it went really smoothly. We pair programmed this portion on Alex's laptop and it really
increased our efficiency.

The other part of this project that I worked on was the class recommendation algorithm. this
is one of the extra things that we are working on for this project. I spent a good amount
of time pseudocoding the algorithm, The idea behind the algorithm is it will filter and sort
our dataset of students until we have a list of students who are most similar to the student 
that is looking for class recommendations and then it will determine which classes they enjoyed
the most and recommend those classes to the student.

Overall this was an excellent section of the project and everyone worked well together!
