For this project I mainly focused on the password reset portion. For example, I added the code neededin the templates to create these pages.

Next, I worked on getting an internal email to be sent to a user that has been generated using 
our mock data. I did this by making a sent emails folder in the team t folder. When a user enters in their email address, a new email will appear in this folder with a link to reset their password.

Lastly, I tried to get the password reset working with real email addresses, but did not 
successfully get it implemented. This might be able to get done once this submission is 
all wrapped up.
